		<p><b>Brandywine</b><br/>
		<i>Also known as "River Through the Pines", Rob Hollett wrote a melody to these wonderful lyrics.</i></p>

		<p>Young Mary was a maiden when the birds began to sing;<br/>
		She was fairer than a blooming rose so early in the spring.<br/>
		Her heart was gay and merry on that morning fair and fine<br/>
		For her lover was a driver from the town of Brandywine.</p>

		<p>Young Charlie used a peavie with a driver's hand and skill,<br/>
		And he swung an axe with energy in the northern forest still.<br/>
		He would labour all the winter and in the summer in the pines<br/>
		And they called him Charlie Williams from the town of Brandywine</p>

		<p>Young Mary, she got married to her lover in the spring<br/>
		When the buds began to blossom and the birds began to sing.<br/>
		"I will labor all the winter and in summer in the pines<br/>
		I'll return to you, my darling, when the fruit is on the vine."</p>

		<p>Young Mary she was faded and no more was gazed upon,<br/>
		For the happiness of her maiden dreams his wild career had run,<br/>
		And early one morning on Wisconsin dreary clime<br/>
		He had run those noisy rapids for his last sad fatal time.</p>

		<p>They found his body lying on the rocky shores below<br/>
		Where the noisy waters ripple and the silent cedars grow.<br/>
		"'I would send to her a letter, but I'm afraid that she'd recline,"<br/>
		Said a friend of Charlie Williams from the town of Brandywine.</p>

		<p>Now every raft of timber that goes down the Chippewa<br/>
		His lonesome grave is visited by drivers on their way.<br/>
		They will plant wild flowers o'er his grave and pluck the weaving vines<br/>
		On the grave of Charlie Williams on the river through the pine.</p>

		<p>In a distance city I visited not many months ago<br/>
		It was in a southern climate where strange faces come and go<br/>
		I saw a gray haired damsel and no more her eyes did shine<br/>
		It was the widow of young Williams from the town of Brandywine</p>

		<p>She smiled as she saw me and she looked so old a gray<br/>
		"I'm prepared to meet my river boy." those words to me did say,<br/>
		"And it's early in the autumn when the fruit is on the vine<br/>
		I will welcome back my river boy to the town of Brandywine"</p>


		<p><b>Waltz With the Woods</b><br/>
		<i>Mark Despault Â© 1985</i></p>

		<p>Lonely the wind moans through the trees<br/>
		Softly the dew is lifting<br/>
		Treasures of soul waltz with the woods<br/>
		Song of my heart, Algonquin</p>

		<p>Paddles have drawn dreamers and seekers<br/>
		Sharing Her wealth and beauty<br/>
		All that she is, is all that she offers<br/>
		This queen of the forest reigns for all time</p>

		<p>Horses and sleighs in the cold nights of winter<br/>
		Smoke from the wood fire rising<br/>
		Natives and rangers, trappers and loggers<br/>
		All left their mark, all touched Her soul</p>

		<p>Many a soul has pasted through these wild woods<br/>
		Many a weary traveler<br/>
		Tired and torn from a world filled with madness<br/>
		Seeking the strength that this earth can bring</p>

		<p>And given this gift of wildwoods and water<br/>
		Silver of winter gold from the fall<br/>
		With peace in their hearts they faded to darkness<br/>
		Leaving their spirits to waltz with the woods</p>
